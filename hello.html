    <h1>Mirsad Sadikovic</h1>
    <p> My past art designing experiance wasnt much but its starting! Ive had the opportunity to to work with a local artist in louisville for a gun violance awareness. Also got the opportunity to get my art work posted outside of JCTC. </p>
    <p> I hope to learn a lot in this class and get my degree soon and put it into use. Hopefully to build my name and do make a website and art for a close friend of mine that has a growing business and just expand from there. Im a go with the flow type of person. </p>
